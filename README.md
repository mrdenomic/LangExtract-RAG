## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to LangExtract-RAG! This project shows how Google's **LangExtract** improves traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It adds intelligent metadata extraction for better outcomes. 

### The Problem with Traditional RAG
Traditional RAG systems face several challenges:
- **Mixed contexts** from different versions
- **Conflicting information** in responses
- **Generic answers** that lack specificity
- **No awareness of document versions or services**

### The LangExtract Solution
LangExtract addresses these challenges by adding a metadata intelligence layer. This layer:
- **Extracts structured metadata** such as document versions and types
- **Filters documents before retrieval** for faster responses
- **Delivers precise, version-specific answers**
- **Removes context confusion** for clearer results
